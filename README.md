Welcome to **Trillo**, a landing page for a comprehensive booking service that allows users to book a house, flights, car rentals, and tours. This project focuses on delivering a clean and responsive interface built using **HTML** and **SCSS** to provide a seamless user experience.

## Project Overview

Trillo offers an all-in-one solution for travel and accommodation bookings, making it easy for users to plan and manage their trips. The design emphasizes responsiveness and user-friendliness, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.

- **NPM Libraries**: Streamlining the development process.
- **Animations**: Added to create a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Design Using `rem`
To ensure the website adapts to all screen sizes, **`rem` units** have been used instead of pixels. This makes the website fully responsive and accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

- **Responsive for Different Screen Sizes**: The webpage is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

### 2. Power of SCSS
The use of **SCSS** in Trillo provides several advantages:

- **Variables**: Stores values like colors, fonts, and breakpoints in one place for easy reuse and modification.
- **Mixins**: Allows code reuse, reducing repetition and enhancing maintainability.
- **Partials**: Splits code into separate files for better modularization and debugging.

### 3. Amazing Animations
The page includes amazing animations to create a dynamic and visually appealing user experience, making the website more engaging for users.
